# Wanorexia
Thank you for the download. This is C# source and just the executable for the Wanorexia program.

This iterates through a file tree, going down, from the Wanorexia file's position. This program then consolidates all of those files
and moves them to a consolidation folder at the script's relative position in the file tree. This was made with people who torrent a lot or people who get many folders and want the files consolidated into a single folder.

WARNING: DO NOT USE IN YOUR HOME/C:/ folder!!!! This has no safety mechanism!

I would compile this using VisualStudio. It was written using VisualStudio.
