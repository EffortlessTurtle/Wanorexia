# Wanorexia
Thank you for the download. This is C# source for the Wanorexia program.

This iterates through a targeted file tree, going down, from where its target is designated. This program then consolidates all of those files
and moves them to a consolidation folder. This was made with people who torrent a lot or people who get many folders and want the files but not
any subfolders consolidated into a folder.

I would compile this using VisualStudio. It was written using VisualStudio.
