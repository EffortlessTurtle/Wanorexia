Thank you for the download! This is C# source code and the executable for the Wanorexia program.

This iterates through a file tree, going down from the Wanorexia file's position. This program then consolidates all of those files
and moves/copies them to a consolidation folder at the script's position in the file tree. This was made for people who torrent a lot or people who get many folders with subfolders and want the files consolidated into a single folder.

It was written using VisualStudio. Special thanks to Ray!
